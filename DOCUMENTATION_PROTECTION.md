# Documentation Protection System

## üîí Protected Files (Requires Authorization)

### CRITICAL DOCUMENTATION - DO NOT MODIFY WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION
- `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` - Core architecture and rules
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Critical rule summaries  
- `DEVELOPER_CHECKLIST.md` - Required workflows
- `DOCUMENTATION_PROTECTION.md` - This protection system

### AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED FROM: erinb-maker-radio

## üö® BEFORE MODIFYING PROTECTED DOCS

**STOP! Ask these questions:**

1. **Who authorized this change?** 
   - ‚úÖ Only erinb-maker-radio can authorize changes to core documentation
   - ‚ùå No other developers, AI assistants, or contributors can modify core docs

2. **What type of change?**
   - ‚úÖ **Allowed**: Typo fixes, formatting improvements, clarifications
   - ‚úÖ **Allowed**: Adding new sections that don't contradict existing rules
   - ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Changing layer analysis rules (1-4)
   - ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Modifying single fill principle
   - ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Changing AI parameters or success thresholds
   - ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Removing or weakening protections

3. **Is this an emergency?**
   - Only if core documentation contains errors that break the system
   - Document the emergency and get retroactive approval

## üìã Change Authorization Process

### For Minor Changes (typos, formatting):
```
Request: "Permission to fix typo in DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md line 47"
Wait for: Explicit "Yes" or "Approved" from erinb-maker-radio
```

### For Major Changes (rules, architecture):
```
1. Propose change with detailed rationale
2. Include impact analysis on current system
3. Show test results supporting the change
4. Wait for explicit written approval
5. Document the approval in change log
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Protection Mechanisms

### 1. File Permissions (if supported)
```bash
# Make docs read-only (when possible)
chmod 444 DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md
chmod 444 QUICK_REFERENCE.md
chmod 444 DEVELOPER_CHECKLIST.md
```

### 2. Git Hooks (recommended)
```bash
# Pre-commit hook to block protected file changes
#!/bin/bash
protected_files="DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md QUICK_REFERENCE.md DEVELOPER_CHECKLIST.md DOCUMENTATION_PROTECTION.md"

for file in $protected_files; do
    if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "^$file$"; then
        echo "üö® BLOCKED: $file is protected"
        echo "Authorization required from erinb-maker-radio"
        exit 1
    fi
done
```

### 3. Documentation Headers
Each protected file should start with:
```markdown
<!--
üîí PROTECTED DOCUMENT üîí
Changes require authorization from: erinb-maker-radio
Unauthorized modifications will be reverted
Last authorized change: [DATE] by [AUTHORIZER]
-->
```

## üìù Change Log Template

When authorized changes are made:

```markdown
## Change Log - [DOCUMENT NAME]

### [DATE] - [CHANGE DESCRIPTION]
- **Authorized by**: erinb-maker-radio
- **Change type**: [Minor/Major]
- **Rationale**: [Why was this change needed]
- **Impact**: [What systems/processes are affected]
- **Test results**: [If applicable]
```

## üö® Violation Response

### If Unauthorized Changes Detected:
1. **Immediate revert** to last authorized version
2. **Document the violation** in violation log
3. **Notify erinb-maker-radio** immediately
4. **Block further changes** until resolution

### Violation Log Entry:
```
Date: [TIMESTAMP]
File: [FILENAME]
Unauthorized change by: [WHO]
Change type: [DESCRIPTION]
Action taken: Reverted to [COMMIT/VERSION]
Status: [Resolved/Pending]
```

## ‚úÖ Emergency Override

**ONLY for system-breaking documentation errors:**

1. Make minimal fix to restore system function
2. Immediately notify erinb-maker-radio with:
   - What was broken
   - Minimal change made
   - Request retroactive approval
3. Document in emergency log
4. Await approval or prepare to revert

## üîÑ Backup System

### Automatic Protection:
- Git history provides version control
- Protected files should have automatic backups
- Changes should be atomic (all-or-nothing)

### Manual Verification:
- Weekly check of protected files for unauthorized changes
- Compare against authorized change log
- Verify file permissions remain correct

## üéØ Implementation Commands

```bash
# Set up protection (run once)
echo "üîí Setting up documentation protection..."

# Create backup copies
cp DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md.backup
cp QUICK_REFERENCE.md QUICK_REFERENCE.md.backup
cp DEVELOPER_CHECKLIST.md DEVELOPER_CHECKLIST.md.backup

# Set read-only (if filesystem supports)
chmod 444 DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md 2>/dev/null || echo "Read-only not available"
chmod 444 QUICK_REFERENCE.md 2>/dev/null || echo "Read-only not available"
chmod 444 DEVELOPER_CHECKLIST.md 2>/dev/null || echo "Read-only not available"

echo "‚úÖ Protection system active"
```
